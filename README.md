Self balancing binary tree

A self-balancing binary tree, commonly referred to as an AVL tree, is a specialized form of a binary search tree that ensures its equilibrium 
even after the addition or removal of nodes. This equilibrium is achieved through the application of rotations, strategic operations that 
reorganize the tree while upholding its fundamental binary search tree characteristics. When a node is inserted, the tree meticulously examines 
and fine-tunes the balance factors of nodes as needed. In the event of an imbalance, the tree promptly executes rotations to reinstate equilibrium. 
This meticulous self-adjustment process guarantees that the tree maintains a balanced structure.
